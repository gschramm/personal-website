After almost four weeks of silence, it's finally time for new story
from sunny California.
The reason for the unusually long silence is simple.
During the last three weeks, Hélène visited me here in Stanford.
After a bit of time in the Bay Area, we rented a car and went on
10 day "spring-break" road trip through southern California.
In the following Stanford Storiess, I'll write about my favorite moments
of the trip.

Our first stop brought us to Monterey - a small picturesque
coast town situated at the Monterey Bay.
The latter is famous for its rich marine wildlife including
sea otters, harbor seals and also whales.
Since neither of us had ever seen a whale, it was a pretty
obvious choice that we would go a whale watching boat trip.
After a night in a rustic Motel, we went down to Fisherman's
Wharf to get on board on one of many little whale watching boats.
This morning, we were lucky and got two of the last tickets for the
"Star of Monterey" (a boat from "Chris" who operates the oldest
whale watching business in town) that took us on a 3h cruise
through the bay.

As most of you can imagine, I was not too optimistic that we
would actually see whales (I rent tons of disclaimer on
websites that said that there is obviously no guarantee
to see whales).
Fortunately, my pessimism was wrong. After a short time we
could spot two humpback whales at some distance between two
other boats.
Seeing those majestic creatures emerging from the sea, creating
water vapor fountains while expelling air from the blowholes
was spectacular.
It was also impressive to see that both humpbacks seemed not
afraid of humans and came within a few meters to our boat
allowing us to see barnacles at their tail fin.
All in all, a fantastic experience that I can highly recommend.
