After more than 1 day of traveling — some United pilots were stuck at the East Coast due to bad weather — I finally made it to my (temporary) new home in California. I was pretty exhausted after the long flight, but fortunately my new PI picked me at the airport (at 11pm) and drove me to my AirBnB.

My jet lag wasn’t too bad, such that I could already explore the humongous and fantastic Stanford campus on my first weekend. During my first work week, I managed to do most of the admin (e.g. filling forms, doing video trainings, and getting my computers and devices Stanford compliant). Moreover, I also got rid of my biggest worry: I found an affordable, nice and cozy place to stay during my year as visiting instructor at Stanford University. Lastly, my first week here was crowned by a lovely American barbecue in a park on campus organized by my new lab (the Radiological Sciences Laboratory) where I met many of my new colleagues.

Now (2nd weekend) it is time to explore the hills around Stanford on my new (old) bike. Cycling here is truly amazing – something I didn’t expect from living in the US.
