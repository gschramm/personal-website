It is almost the end of Oktober. And while leaves are turning golden and red
everywhere, the German student association at Stanford organized the 
"Stanford Oktoberfest". Since I have never been to the real Oktoberfest in
Munich (which actually takes place at the end of September), 
I thought it would be fun to see the Stanford version.
On top of that there was plenty of free beer and bratwurst - a perfect plan for a
sunny Saturday afternoon in Oktober.
The event took place in the garden of the Bechtel international center at
the Stanford campus and I was not at all disappointed. 
I saw many Germans (and also non-Germans) showing up in Lederhosen or Dirndls,
had two nice Oktoberfest beers and met a couple of interesting people.
The only slight downside was that we had to listen to a lot of Oktoberfest music
a.k.a. horrible German Schlager. Not sure why people like to listen to that,
but I guess it is probably considered German cultural heritage by now ;)

Instead of going on a hike this weekend, I decided to go on a longer bike ride.
Together with a friend, we decided to do two of most famous and beautiful climbs
of this region - Old La Honda and Alpine road. So far I wasn't sure if I could
handle to longer climbs in one ride, but my legs felt really good and in the
end, riding 66 km with 1350m of elevation was fun. 
This means that I am probably ready to go for an even longer ride to the pacific
ocean next weekend.
