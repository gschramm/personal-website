Second week of December and it seems like we are already half way
towards Christmas.
Consequently, it was time for the yearly Christmas party of the
Radiological Science Lab featuring a white elephant.
Don't worry, we did not have a specimen of the largest land animal
invited as special guest - our meeting room is definitely not big
enough for that.
Instead, a white elephant is a method of gift sharing where everyone
brings a wrapped present and puts it on a table.
All participants also get a number and as soon as your number is
called, you can either select and unwrap a present from the
table or steal an already unwrapped present from another person.
There were many fun small little things such as one meter long
hot water bottle or bacon lollipops.
I finally ended up with a nice mug that I am using
for drinking my beloved peppermint tea when I am working in the
office.

On Friday, a colleague invited me to visit a modern dance / theater
performance "Transverse Orientation" from the Greek artist Dimitris Papaioannou
who e.g. directed the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004.
Before seeing the show, I was a bit skeptical since I have seen many
modern dance performances that seemed way too abstract and chaotic to me.
But "Transverse Orientation" was simply breathtaking. It is a genius
mix between dance, theater, circus arts, visual installations and music.
A trailer of the show can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5wTi96QHbU).
Before seeing the actual performance we also went to see a panel discussion
featuring Dimitris Papaioannou where another professor introduced
us to the concept of "selective inattention" which apparently is the
scientific term for describing people falling asleep during
performances. According to the professor part of a good experience and
nothing to be ashamed of.
By the way, "Transverse Orientation" is on a world tour, so there is a chance
that you can see it as well - definitely highly recommended.
