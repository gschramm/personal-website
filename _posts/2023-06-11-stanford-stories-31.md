Yosemite Valley, with its captivating landscapes and natural wonders, has long been a dream
destination for many families.
In May, I took my parents who were visiting from Germany on a 10-day road trip
through California.
After seeing the cost and King's Canyon National Park, including a few gigantic
Sequoia Trees, we went to "the Valley" in Yosemite National Park.

Some of you might remember, that I had been to Yosemite back in September when we
were back packing in the high country.
Back then we were unlucky since the air quality in the valley was very poor due to
nearby wildfires.
Fortunately, this time the conditions were almost perfect.
After a long winter with record-breaking amount of snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains,
we could enjoy two beautiful spring days in Yosemite.
Fueled by enormous amounts of snowmelt, all water falls in the valley were roaring.

On our first day, a long and strenuous hike took us up to Columbia rock and upper
Yosemite falls. On our way up there, some fellow hikers spotted a young black bear right
on the trail.
Unfortunately, I could only see his bottom vanishing in the bushes, which is why I
couldn't capture any photographic evidence.

After a night in a "glamping" tent right inside the valley, we decided to take easier
our second day and hiked to the well-known Mirror Lake and then up the "Mist trail"
to see Vernon falls.
This hike is called "Mist trail" since you come very close to the falls such that
people feel the mist coming from the falls.
On that day, however, "Monsoon" or "Niagara" trail would have been more appropriate.

Seeing the ulta steep 1000m walls of Yosemite Valley reminded me of my climbing past
and made me freeze in awe at the thought of the climbers who soloed them.
