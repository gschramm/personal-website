I cannot believe that today is already the 4th advent - time is flying.
Over one week there is christmas and I will be back to Belgium and Germany
for a nice long winter break.
In the office it is getting much quieter now, since everybody seems to be in Holiday
mood already.
I am definitely as well, but I need to finish a last paper before I can
enjoy my trip to Europe.

Since nothing too special happened this week, I used the occasion and
took two photos on the campus of the Stanford School of Medicine -
the place where I work every day.
Did you know that the Stanford School of Medicine is home to five living
Nobel Laureates?
Pretty impressive but also a tiny bit scary to be surrounded by so
many great minds.

Speaking of great (or not so great) minds: Since end of November there
are [allegations](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/12/15/latest-updates-stanford-president-under-investigation-for-research-misconduct/) against the neuro scientist and current president of Stanford Marc Tessier-Lavigne
for scientific misconduct.
Apparently, in several articles that he co-authored (some as senior author)
images seem to be manipulated.
Let's see what Stanford's internal committee will find.
For now, three of the papers already issued editorial expressions of concern.
