The next stop of our road trip through California lead us to Death Valley.
Despite its name, Death Valley is a sanctuary of solace and introspection.
Its vastness and remoteness offer an unparalleled opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle
of everyday life and immerse oneself in the simplicity of existence.
Remoteness and simplicity are also the words that perfectly describe Shoshone, a place
with around 22 inhabitants and - most importantly - a super comfortable and cozy Inn.
Next to the Inn, Shoshone also features a junction of two state routs, a gas station
(including a general store), and a bar. What else do you need?
And - needless to say - the last roadside service for about 100 km.

One of the most captivating aspects of Death Valley is the breathtaking display of colors
that unfolds during sunset.
As the sun gradually descends, the barren desert landscape transforms into a vibrant canvas,
painted with hues of fiery reds, oranges, and soft purples.
It's as if nature itself is putting on a magical show, reminding us of the beauty that lies in simplicity.
We were lucky to witness two of those breath-taking sunsets while we were there.
One at Dante's view overlooking badwater basin and Telescope peak, and a second
even more impressive one while leaving the park and driving to our following.

While planning the road trip, I wasn't 100% sure whether driving all the way to
Death Valley will be worth it.
Now I can say with all my heart: yes it is.
But make sure you go there in winter or spring when the temperatures are still
bearable.
