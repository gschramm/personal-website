"Something a little more comfortable up on the hill", this is what publishing
tycoon William Randolph Hearst commissioned architect Julia Morgan to build a
few month after of the death of his mother Phoebe Hearst.
"A little more comfortable" is quite an understatement if you have seen
Hearst Castle in San Simeon at the Pacific coast in California.
Hearst made a fortune with yellow journalism newspapers
(later with questionable political views) and, based on impressions
on art and architecture he got while traveling through Europe with his mother
when he was a child, wanted to build his own castle in California.

As an architect he chose Julia Morgan, the first female American architect that
received her degree in Paris.
The collaboration between them was fruitful and productive and over many years,
Hearst castle was build on a gorgeous hill overlooking the Pacific.
The castle itself was never completely finished because (a) for Hearst and Morgan the process
of building and creating itself seemed most important and (b) Hearst got into
financial problems in the 1930s.

Wandering through the castle, which is only possible in guided tours,
you can see a mix of many different architectural styles
full of details and ornaments.
Inside you can find an insane collection of famous art pieces and furniture
from many centuries from all over the world.
The area on the hill around the castle also featured a private zoo with all kind
of exotic animals to entertain the famous guests that were often invited
for parties (e.g. Winston Churchil, Charly Chaplin, or Charles Lindbergh).
After Hearst got into financial troubles, most animals had to be sold.
Fun fact, apparently some zebras escaped and are still living in the area today.
