After exactly three months in California, I got the chance to spend a week
in "good old Europe" again. The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference brought me to the
lovely city of Milan in Italy. Apparently, many Italians are not particularly
fond of Milan, but compared to most places in California, Belgium and Germany,
it is still an amazing place.

The city center is full of historic landmarks such as the cathedral (Duomo) or
the Sforzeco castle. Moreover, there is plenty of breath-taking art to admire,
such as the Da Vinci's "Last supper" and the San Maurizio monastery with its
Sistine-like chapel. And if shopping is your thing, you can find tons of
luxury boutiques in what is known as the "golden triangle of fashion".

It was also great to be in person at the IEEE MIC conference again where I
was able to catch up with many old friends and colleagues. Moreover, my
PI from Leuven got a pretty prestigious award in our field - so plenty of
reasons to celebrate and to be happy.

However, the by far best thing was that I was able to see Hélène after
three long months again. We had three wonderful days enjoying the atmosphere
of Milan and plenty of amazing and very affordable food.
Now, I am already counting the days until Christmas when it is time for my
next trip to Europe.
