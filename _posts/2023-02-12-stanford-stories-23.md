The second Sunday in February - for some sports fans the most important
holidy of the (sports) year.
You might have guessed it, last Sunday it was time for Super Bowl LVII.
For all of you that don't follow any (sports) news: The Super Bowl is
the annual final of the American Football leagues (NFL) where the champions
of the two NFL conferences (NFL and AFC) meet to determine the league
champion.
This year, Super Bowl LVII was hosted in Glendale, Arizona where
the Philadelphia Eagles (NFC champion) played the Kansas City Chiefs
(AFC champion).

For me personally, the game was special since (a) I could watch it in the
late afternoon, instead of getting up in the middle of the night and (b)
the game featured the two best and most complete teams of the season promising
an close and exciting game.
Together with a few friends and colleagues, we decided to watch the game
in the EVGR Pub at Stanford campus.
The atmosphere in the pub was very cheerful with students supporting both
teams.

The game itself was one of the best and most exciting Super Bowls in
a long time.
Both offenses played outstanding, many points were scored and in the end the game
was decided with a game winning field goal in the last seconds of the
4th quarter.
Unfortunately, I was supporting the Eagles who lost 35-38.
Still under the impression of the painful defeat,
Jalen Hurts, the quarter back of the Philadelphia Eagles, who played
a great game, but also made a crucial mistakes, said in an interview:
"You either win or learn."
A wisdom that not only applies to American Football.
