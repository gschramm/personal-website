After out conference in Milan, Italy, my first week back at Stanford started
with two retreats.
On Monday, we had the retreat of the whole Department of Radiology at Stanford
where all groups within the department (ca. 200 researchers) presented their
work and discussed the "future of radiology".
Obviously, there was a lot of fuss about AI in radiology,
but more interestingly people also discussed on how to make health care more
accessible and affordable here.
For me as a person having lived in two European countries
with working public health care systems, the solution to the latter discussion
seemed rather trivial.
Our group, presented the research of our labs in very fun Jeopardy-like game
which was very well received by the other groups.

On Tuesday, we had a second smaller half-day retreat of our research group -
the Radiological Sciences Lab (RSL).
It took place at the Lucy Stern community center in Palo Alto - a cozy place
originally used by the local Scouts.
After enjoying an invited talk on Biomechanics, we had an outside poster session
with breakfast burritos around a campfire.
I wish more conferences would organize such poster sessions.

The rest of the week as not very eventful, but every day on my bike ride to
work, I really enjoyed all the trees glowing in full yellow and red illuminated
by the morning sun.
Btw, the weather here is still amazing.
During the day, we still get between 15 and 20 degrees Celsius :).
