Born in 1987 in GÃ¶rlitz, Germany, I spent my childhood engrossed in football and playing saxophone and clarinet in the local music school's big band. In 2005, I moved to Dresden to study physics at TU Dresden, later completing an Erasmus semester at the University of Sheffield in 2009. I earned my **Master's in physics in 2011**, ranking among the top five graduates in TU Dresden's School of Science.

In 2015, I obtained a **PhD (Dr. rer. medic) in medical imaging** with the highest distinction (summa cum laude) from TU Dresden / Helmholz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf.
Following seven years as a **Postdoc at KU Leuven**, Belgium, focusing on advanced image reconstruction techniques for molecular imaging, I spent a year as a **visiting instructor at Stanford University**, CA, working on sodium MR image reconstruction.

Currently, I am an **Assistant Professor in Molecular Image Reconstruction and Analysis at KU Leuven**, emphasizing improved diagnostic image quality through advanced modeling, cutting-edge reconstruction algorithms, and sustainable machine learning techniques. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, photography, cycling, and I am proud fan of the San Francisco 49ers.
