The reason for my silence is pretty straightforward. My time at Stanford wrapped up at the end of July, and in the meantime, I’ve packed up and moved back to Belgium (more on that later).</p> <p>So, thanks to a four-week grace period after my visa expired in July, Hélène and I made the most of the first three weeks of August with another epic camping road trip. This time, instead of heading south, we took the scenic route north along the stunning coast of northern California, Oregon, and Washington, all the way up to Northern Cascades National Park. We also made stops in Portland and Seattle before winding our way back to the Bay Area, clocking in roughly 3000 miles (4800 km) on the road.</p> <p>Now, having seen pretty much the entire west coast from Los Angeles to Seattle, I have to admit I’m more of a fan of the rugged coasts of northern California and Oregon. Those steep cliffs, incredible sea stacks, and the mild, pleasant summer weather won me over compared to the more popular southern California coastline. Plus, it was a pleasant surprise to find that even during the peak summer season, most of the places we visited were surprisingly uncrowded. That meant more quality time soaking in the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest.</p> <p>To keep our budget in check, we split our nights between campgrounds and motels. Camping on the west coast is a breeze, not just because it barely rains from April to November but also due to the abundance of well-equipped campgrounds, even directly in the middle of National Parks. It seems like camping is a quintessential part of the American spirit.</p> <p>In addition to the jaw-dropping nature, we also spent a couple of days in Portland and Seattle. Both cities were fascinating, each in its own way. Portland boasts a thriving cultural scene, tons of delicious food trucks, and the mother of all bookstores. On the downside, downtown Portland has a serious issue with homelessness and addiction, maybe even worse than San Francisco’s Tenderloin. Seattle, on the other hand, wowed us with its iconic Pike Place Market, beautiful parks, museums, the famous Space Needle, and waterfront views galore. Not to mention the stunning sight of Mount Rainier, which looms large about 100km away.</p> <p>Upon our return to the Bay Area, following our exploration of three magnificent volcanoes within the Cascade Range (an experience that brought me closer to these geological wonders than ever before), we enjoyed two more nights as guests in the homes of friends. Subsequently, we boarded a flight bound for Leuven, Belgium, where I have taken on the role of Assistant Professor at the local university (KU Leuven). If you’re curious about this new chapter of my life, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I may consider initiating a fresh series of blog posts.</p> <p>Finally, I wish to extend my gratitude to a few exceptional persons who made this past year truly exceptional, memorable, and delightful for me. A special thank you to Fernando, Olga, Marios, Valentina, Phil, Kian, Maria, Johanna, and Orkan. Getting to know you and spending time with you has been a gift beyond measure.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/35/DSCF6081-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/35/DSCF6081-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/35/DSCF6081-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/35/DSCF6081.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null;

As a child, I had heard captivating stories about the Grand Canyon, which symbolizes the wild west and the awe-inspiring beauty of the United States. Surprisingly, the Grand Canyon wasn’t initially on my list of must-see places during my time in the States. However, a close colleague and friend recently shared stunning pictures from their weekend trip to the canyon, igniting a spark of curiosity within me and four of my friends. We decided to embark on a long weekend road trip around the Grand Canyon, starting from Las Vegas.</p> <p>Our journey began with a scenic drive from Nevada to the South Rim of the Canyon in Arizona. After a relatively short 4.5-hour drive, we reached our destination just in time to witness the mesmerizing sunset at Mather’s Point. The warm hues of orange as the last rays of sunlight kissed the mighty cliffs left us speechless, filled with a sense of wonder and amazement. We swiftly set up our tents at a nearby campground before darkness fell, preparing a simple dinner to enjoy together. As we crawled into our sleeping bags, a profound sense of contentment and pride washed over us, grateful for the adventure that awaited us in the days ahead.</p> <p>The next morning, we eagerly set out on a hike along the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. The trail wound its way along the edge, offering breathtaking vistas at every turn. As we hiked, we couldn’t help but be in awe of the immense scale of the canyon. Its vastness seemed infinite, with layers of rock stretching deep into the Earth’s crust. The sheer magnitude of the canyon’s depth, plunging over a mile into the earth, is a testament to the forces of nature that shaped this remarkable wonder over millions of years.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF4703-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF4703-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF4703-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF4703.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Sunset at Mather Point, Grand Canyon National Park. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF4804-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF4804-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF4804-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF4804.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Grand Canyon South Rim. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF4931-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF4931-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF4931-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF4931.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Grand Canyon Squirrel. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF5064-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF5064-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF5064-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/33/DSCF5064.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Sunset at the Horseshoe Bend. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="stanford-stories"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine a group of young Stanford postdocs, instructors, and friends embarking on an extraordinary adventure to the magnificent Grand Canyon.

Zion Canyon - located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions in south western Utah - features amazing steep walls made of reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River.</p> <p>Interestingly, former President Taft named the region Mukuntuweap National Monument in 1908. But in 1918, the acting director of the National Park service proposed to change the name to Zion because it was believed that people would not visit Parks that hard to pronounce.</p> <p>We started our day by taking the shuttle bus that transports visitors into the valley during summer to the final stop called “Temple of Sinawava” - a massive “amphitheater” that unofficially marks the beginning of the canyon. Starting from there, it possible to hike into the actual canyon of the Virgin river called “the Narrows”. Although being a very hot June day in Utah, this hike is very refreshing since (a) you are in a very narrow canyon surrounded by tall sandstone walls creating tons of shade and (b) you are walking inside the shallow Virgin River for most of the time.</p> <p>After this refreshment including wet feet and shoes for all of us - you need shoes to walk over the stones in the river bed - we headed back to toward the Park entrance where we once again amazed by the late afternoon sun light illuminating the red Navajo sandstone formations. Before we had to drive back to Las Vegas, we spent a last night in an Air BnB in the small town of Hurricane including dinner at “Dairy Queen” which to my surprise is not a place for ice cream and milk shakes, but instead serves good old American fast food.</p> <p>All in all, we had a fantastic 3.5 day road trip around the Grand Canyon with lots of stunning views. I am very happy that we decided to go on this trip with an amazing group of colleagues and friends.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/34/DSCF5156-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/34/DSCF5156-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/34/DSCF5156-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/34/DSCF5156.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Zion scenic drive viewpoint 2. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/34/DSCF5329-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/34/DSCF5329-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/34/DSCF5329-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/34/DSCF5329.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Court of the Patiachs. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/34/DSCF5405-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/34/DSCF5405-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/34/DSCF5405-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/34/DSCF5405.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The Watchman. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="stanford-stories"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After spending a night in Page, Arizona where we could witness another spectacular sunset at the Horseshoe Bend (see photo from last post), the next scenic stop of our road trip was Zion National Park.

Stanford University’s commencement ceremony - held annually in Stanford’ football stadium - is renowned for its grandeur, inspiring speeches, and the sense of pride and accomplishment that fills the air.</p> <p>In the realm of academia, certain traditions have stood the test of time, adding a sense of distinction and significance to commencement ceremonies. Among these enduring customs is the American academic dress, which most of you will have seen and and associate with the American student life. Originating in Britain, the dress consists of a gown (a loose outer garment worn by men and women) and the square-shaped mortarboard cap including a tassel. Til now the thought of putting on such a dress had always repelled me - I might even have called it “silly”. However, after seeing this very dignified and tasteful ceremony, I realized that it is a nice symbol that represents the act of graduation.</p> <p>After the usual speeches by the president and different deans, the highlight of this years commencement ceremony was a keynote speech by the esteemed tennis legend John McEnroe. During his keynote address, McEnroe, who studied a year at Stanford in 1978, emphasized the importance of embracing challenges and learning from failures. Drawing from his own experiences, he shared anecdotes of his early setbacks and how they fueled his drive for success. McEnroe, in contrast to all other speakers, also made the entire stadium laugh heartily several times. E.g. by telling that Stanford asked him to give the keynote speech already in March just after his daughter told him that the Stanford law school had rejected her application and that apparently his recommendation letter was not very helpful. My personal highlight of the ceremony were, however, a bunch of students who honored McEnroe’s presence by dressing up as Swedish long-haired tennis legend Bjorn Borg - McEnroes arch rival for many years.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4307-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4307-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4307-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4307.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Stanford undergraduate and graduate students walking to the official commencement ceremony held in the Stanford football stadium. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4367-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4367-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4367-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4367.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Student wearing the typical academic dress consisting of mortarboard cap with with tassel and gown. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4527-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4527-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4527-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4527.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Proud parents and families watching the processing, which is concluded by the entrance of the president. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4605-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4605-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4605-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/32/DSCF4605.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Students of the school of economics celebrating their degrees. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="stanford-stories"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The culmination of years of hard work, dedication, and personal growth, a commencement ceremony marks a significant milestone in the lives of graduates.

In May, I took my parents who were visiting from Germany on a 10-day road trip through California. After seeing the cost and King’s Canyon National Park, including a few gigantic Sequoia Trees, we went to “the Valley” in Yosemite National Park.</p> <p>Some of you might remember, that I had been to Yosemite back in September when we were back packing in the high country. Back then we were unlucky since the air quality in the valley was very poor due to nearby wildfires. Fortunately, this time the conditions were almost perfect. After a long winter with record-breaking amount of snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains, we could enjoy two beautiful spring days in Yosemite. Fueled by enormous amounts of snowmelt, all water falls in the valley were roaring.</p> <p>On our first day, a long and strenuous hike took us up to Columbia rock and upper Yosemite falls. On our way up there, some fellow hikers spotted a young black bear right on the trail. Unfortunately, I could only see his bottom vanishing in the bushes, which is why I couldn’t capture any photographic evidence.</p> <p>After a night in a “glamping” tent right inside the valley, we decided to take easier our second day and hiked to the well-known Mirror Lake and then up the “Mist trail” to see Vernon falls. This hike is called “Mist trail” since you come very close to the falls such that people feel the mist coming from the falls. On that day, however, “Monsoon” or “Niagara” trail would have been more appropriate.</p> <p>Seeing the ulta steep 1000m walls of Yosemite Valley reminded me of my climbing past and made me freeze in awe at the thought of the climbers who soloed them.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/31/DSCF3117-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/31/DSCF3117-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/31/DSCF3117-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/31/DSCF3117.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Yosemite Valley seen from Tunnel View. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/31/DSCF3136-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/31/DSCF3136-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/31/DSCF3136-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/31/DSCF3136.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> El Capitan. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/31/DSCF3319-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/31/DSCF3319-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/31/DSCF3319-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/31/DSCF3319.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Upper Yosemite Fall. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="stanford-stories"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yosemite Valley, with its captivating landscapes and natural wonders, has long been a dream destination for many families.

Despite its name, Death Valley is a sanctuary of solace and introspection. Its vastness and remoteness offer an unparalleled opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and immerse oneself in the simplicity of existence. Remoteness and simplicity are also the words that perfectly describe Shoshone, a place with around 22 inhabitants and - most importantly - a super comfortable and cozy Inn. Next to the Inn, Shoshone also features a junction of two state routs, a gas station (including a general store), and a bar. What else do you need? And - needless to say - the last roadside service for about 100 km.</p> <p>One of the most captivating aspects of Death Valley is the breathtaking display of colors that unfolds during sunset. As the sun gradually descends, the barren desert landscape transforms into a vibrant canvas, painted with hues of fiery reds, oranges, and soft purples. It’s as if nature itself is putting on a magical show, reminding us of the beauty that lies in simplicity. We were lucky to witness two of those breath-taking sunsets while we were there. One at Dante’s view overlooking badwater basin and Telescope peak, and a second even more impressive one while leaving the park and driving to our following.</p> <p>While planning the road trip, I wasn’t 100% sure whether driving all the way to Death Valley will be worth it. Now I can say with all my heart: yes it is. But make sure you go there in winter or spring when the temperatures are still bearable.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/30/DSCF1795-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/30/DSCF1795-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/30/DSCF1795-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/30/DSCF1795.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Sunset at Dante's view. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/30/DSCF1841-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/30/DSCF1841-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/30/DSCF1841-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/30/DSCF1841.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Entrance of Death Valley National Park close to Shoshone.

Our first stop was Joshua Tree National Park which is a stunning desert oasis featuring the iconic Joshua tree which is actually not a tree, but rather a tree-like genus of the Yucca plant. Apparently, the tree got his name from a group of (dehydrated?) Mormons (or an Irish rockband) crossing the Mojave dessert being reminded of a certain prophet.</p> <p>Personally, I have never been in a desert, so I was a bit unsure what to expect except dry weather, rocks, dust and a few thorny trees. Already on our first evening in the park, I was overwhelmed by the orange and blue colors of the afternoon light settling on the rocks and boulders of the high desert. At keys view overlooking the low desert, we could see a magical sunset before securing one of the last spots for dinner in the apparently famous “Cross roads cafe” serving classical American road trip food: sandwiches, burgers, fries … and something called a “french dip”. Derived from the French expression “au jus” (with juice) this is a hot sandwich consisting of thinly sliced roast beef in a baguette typically served with a dipping container of beef broth produced from the cooking process. A highly recommend dinner, after a day in the desert.</p> <p>Joshua Tree National Park is also one of the best star gazing areas in the country due to its very low levels of light pollution and arid conditions. Unfortunately, we were “unlucky” because we were visiting during a full moon period. On the other hand, we were rewarded with a few spectacular views on a giant full moon rising above the desert.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1741-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1741-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1741-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1741.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Joshua Trees in the "High Desert" with the snow-capped San Bernadino mountains in the background. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1706-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1706-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1706-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1706.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Climbing the rocks of Joshua Tree. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1653-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1653-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1653-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1653.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Sunset at Keys views. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1747-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1747-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1747-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/29/DSCF1747.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Full moon at the park entrance. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="stanford-stories"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a brief stop in the hills of LA where we hiked up the Griffith Observatory, we continued our road trip leaving the Californian pacific coast towards the Mojave desert.

Hearst made a fortune with yellow journalism newspapers (later with questionable political views) and, based on impressions on art and architecture he got while traveling through Europe with his mother when he was a child, wanted to build his own castle in California.</p> <p>As an architect he chose Julia Morgan, the first female American architect that received her degree in Paris. The collaboration between them was fruitful and productive and over many years, Hearst castle was build on a gorgeous hill overlooking the Pacific. The castle itself was never completely finished because (a) for Hearst and Morgan the process of building and creating itself seemed most important and (b) Hearst got into financial problems in the 1930s.</p> <p>Wandering through the castle, which is only possible in guided tours, you can see a mix of many different architectural styles full of details and ornaments. Inside you can find an insane collection of famous art pieces and furniture from many centuries from all over the world. The area on the hill around the castle also featured a private zoo with all kind of exotic animals to entertain the famous guests that were often invited for parties (e.g. Winston Churchil, Charly Chaplin, or Charles Lindbergh). After Hearst got into financial troubles, most animals had to be sold. Fun fact, apparently some zebras escaped and are still living in the area today.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/28/DSCF1530-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/28/DSCF1530-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/28/DSCF1530-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/28/DSCF1530.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> View from Hearst castle on the Pacific. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/28/DSCF1551-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/28/DSCF1551-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/28/DSCF1551-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/28/DSCF1551.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Roman indoor pool at Hearst castle. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/28/DSCF1515-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/28/DSCF1515-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/28/DSCF1515-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/28/DSCF1515.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Hearst castle on the "enchanted hill". </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="stanford-stories"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Something a little more comfortable up on the hill”, this is what publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst commissioned architect Julia Morgan to build a few month after of the death of his mother Phoebe Hearst. “A little more comfortable” is quite an understatement if you have seen Hearst Castle in San Simeon at the Pacific coast in California.

The reason for the unusually long silence is simple. During the last three weeks, Hélène visited me here in Stanford. After a bit of time in the Bay Area, we rented a car and went on 10 day “spring-break” road trip through southern California. In the following Stanford Storiess, I’ll write about my favorite moments of the trip.</p> <p>Our first stop brought us to Monterey - a small picturesque coast town situated at the Monterey Bay. The latter is famous for its rich marine wildlife including sea otters, harbor seals and also whales. Since neither of us had ever seen a whale, it was a pretty obvious choice that we would go a whale watching boat trip. After a night in a rustic Motel, we went down to Fisherman’s Wharf to get on board on one of many little whale watching boats. This morning, we were lucky and got two of the last tickets for the “Star of Monterey” (a boat from “Chris” who operates the oldest whale watching business in town) that took us on a 3h cruise through the bay.</p> <p>As most of you can imagine, I was not too optimistic that we would actually see whales (I rent tons of disclaimer on websites that said that there is obviously no guarantee to see whales). Fortunately, my pessimism was wrong. After a short time we could spot two humpback whales at some distance between two other boats. Seeing those majestic creatures emerging from the sea, creating water vapor fountains while expelling air from the blowholes was spectacular. It was also impressive to see that both humpbacks seemed not afraid of humans and came within a few meters to our boat allowing us to see barnacles at their tail fin. All in all, a fantastic experience that I can highly recommend.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1185-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1185-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1185-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1185.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Bixby Creek Bridge at the Pacific Highway close to Monterey. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1347-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1347-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1347-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1347.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Whale watching in the Monterey bay. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1375-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1375-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1375-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1375.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Tail fin of a humpback whale very close to our boat. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1476-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1476-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1476-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/27/DSCF1476.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Sunset on "sunset avenue" in Carmel-by-the-Sea. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="stanford-stories"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After almost four weeks of silence, it’s finally time for new story from sunny California. The reason for the unusually long silence is simple. During the last three weeks, Hélène visited me here in Stanford. After a bit of time in the Bay Area, we rented a car and went on 10 day “spring-break” road trip through southern California. In the following Stanford Storiess, I’ll write about my favorite moments of the trip.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stanford Stories XXVI - March Madness</title><link href="https://gschramm.github.io/blog/2023/stanford-stories-26/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stanford Stories XXVI - March Madness"/><published>2023-03-19T05:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-19T05:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gschramm.github.io/blog/2023/stanford-stories-26</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gschramm.github.io/blog/2023/stanford-stories-26/"><![CDATA[<p>March Madness is a term that I didn’t know until very recently. Based on the name you might think that it refers to (a) the week after Mardi Gras, (b) the unusual wet weather we had in California in the last three weeks or (c) the student spring break week. None of the three answers is correct. Instead, March Madness is an annual college basketball tournament that takes place in March and April. In a 6 round single knock out tournament, 64 teams from across the United States compete for the national championship title.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, I went to see my first college basketball game featuring the Stanford women’s team against UCLA. Here at Stanford, the women’s team, in contrast to the men’s teams, is one of the best teams in the country. Two years ago the Stanford Cardinal managed to win the national championship title. Because of an excellent regular season, Stanford received one of the top seeds for this year’s March Madness tournament.</p> <p>After a clear win in the first round against Sacred Heart, the Cardinal welcomed Ole Miss (University of Mississippi) in round of the last 32. Unfortunately, after a very physical and close game Stanford lost despite a thrilling 4th quarter comeback. Although we were all slightly depressed after the somewhat unexpected loss, I must say that the three college basketball games I have seen during the last weeks, were the most fun and exciting sports events in a very long time.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/26/DSCF9932-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/26/DSCF9932-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/26/DSCF9932-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/26/DSCF9932.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Tip off between Stanford and UCLA. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/26/DSCF0525-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/26/DSCF0525-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/26/DSCF0525-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/26/DSCF0525.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fear the tree (the official Stanford mascot). </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/stanford-stories/26/DSCF0710-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/26/DSCF0710-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/stanford-stories/26/DSCF0710-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/stanford-stories/26/DSCF0710.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Spring has arrived in Menlo Park. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="stanford-stories"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[March Madness is a term that I didn’t know until very recently.
